## Introduction
The crazyradio 2.0 does not come preloaded with firmware so you will have to load firmware onto the crazyradio 2.0 every time you buy a new one or an update comes out. In the future the crazyradio 2.0 is expected to have enhanced features that will be enabled by new firmware releases. As of the writing of this guide, the crazyradio 2.0 firmware simply emulates the crazyradio PA.

## Installing Firmware
Intalling firmware onto the crazyradio 2.0 is simple. This should be done on your regular operating system, not through WSL or a virtual machine.

Please refer to [bitcrazes documentation on installing firmware for the crazyradio 2.0](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-crazyradio-2-0/).
